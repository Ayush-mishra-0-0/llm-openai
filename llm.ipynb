reasonable minds feel\\nby a sort of instinct, often without being able to account for it. ...It is remarkable\\nthat this science, which originated in the consideration of games of chance, should\\nhave become the most important object of human knowledge. ...The most impor-\\ntant questions of life are, for the most part, really only problems of probability.” Sosaid the famous French mathematician and astronomer (the “Newton of France”)Pierre-Simon, Marquis de Laplace. Although many people believe that the famous\\nmarquis, who was also one of the great contributors to the development of probabil-\\nity, might have exaggerated somewhat, it is nevertheless true that probability theoryhas become a tool of fundamental importance to nearly all scientists, engineers, med-\\nical practitioners, jurists, and industrialists. In fact, the enlightened individual had\\nlearned to ask not “Is it so?” but rather “What is the probability that it is so?”\\nGeneral Approach and Mathematical Level\\nThis book is intended as an elementary introduction to the theory of probability\\nfor students in mathematics, statistics, engineering, and the sciences (including com-\\nputer science, biology, the social sciences, and management science) who possess theprerequisite knowledge of elementary calculus. It attempts to present not only the\\nmathematics of probability theory, but also, through numerous examples, the many\\ndiverse possible applications of this subject.\\nContent and Course Planning\\nChapter 1 presents the basic principles of combinatorial analysis, which are most\\nuseful in computing probabilities.\\nChapter 2 handles the axioms of probability theory and shows how they can be\\napplied to compute various probabilities of interest.\\nChapter 3 deals with the extremely important subjects of conditional probability\\nand independence of events. By a series of examples, we illustrate how conditional\\nprobabilities come into play not only when some partial information is available,\\nbut also as a tool to enable us to compute probabilities more easily, even when\\nno partial information is present. This extremely important technique of obtainingprobabilities by “conditioning” reappears in Chapter 7, where we use it to obtain\\nexpectations.\\nThe concept of random variables is introduced in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Discrete\\nrandom variables are dealt with in Chapter 4, continuous random variables inChapter 5, and jointly distributed random variables in Chapter 6. The important con-\\ncepts of the expected value and the variance of a random variable are introduced inChapters 4 and 5, and these quantities are then determined for many of the common\\ntypes of random variables.\\n8', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='Preface 9\\nAdditional properties of the expected value are considered in Chapter 7. Many\\nexamples illustrating the usefulness of the result that the expected value of a sum\\nof random variables is equal to the sum of their expected values are presented.Sections on conditional expectation, including its use in prediction, and on moment-\\ngenerating functions are contained in this chapter. In addition, the ﬁnal section intro-\\nduces the multivariate normal distribution and presents a simple proof concerningthe joint distribution of the sample mean and sample variance of a sample from a\\nnormal distribution.\\nChapter 8 presents the major theoretical results of probability theory. In par-\\nticular, we prove the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.\\nOur proof of the strong law is a relatively simple one that assumes that the randomvariables have a ﬁnite fourth moment, and our proof of the central limit theorem\\nassumes Levy’s continuity theorem. This chapter also presents such probability\\ninequalities as Markov’s inequality, Chebyshev’s inequality, and Chernoff bounds.The ﬁnal section of Chapter 8 gives a bound on the error involved when a probability\\nconcerning a sum of independent Bernoulli random variables is approximated by the\\ncorresponding probability of a Poisson random variable having the same expectedvalue.\\nChapter 9 presents some additional topics, such as Markov chains, the Poisson\\nprocess, and an introduction to information and coding theory, and Chapter 10 con-siders simulation.\\nAs in the previous edition, three sets of exercises are given at the end of each\\nchapter. They are designated as Problems, Theoretical Exercises , and Self-Test Prob-\\nlems and Exercises. This last set of exercises, for which complete solutions appear in\\nSolutions to Self-Test Problems and Exercises, is designed to help students test their\\ncomprehension and study for exams.\\nChanges for the Tenth Edition\\nThe tenth edition continues the evolution and ﬁne tuning of the text. Aside from amultitude of small changes made to increase the clarity of the text, the new editionincludes many new and updated problems, exercises, and text material chosen both\\nfor inherent interest and for their use in building student intuition about probability.\\nIllustrative of these goals are Examples 4n of Chapter 3, which deals with comput-ing NCAA basketball tournament win probabilities, and Example 5b of Chapter 4,\\nwhich introduces the friendship paradox. There is also new material on the Pareto\\ndistribution (introduced in Section 5.6.5), on Poisson limit results (in Section 8.5),and on the Lorenz curve (in Section 8.7).\\nAcknowledgments\\nI would like to thank the following people who have graciously taken the time tocontact me with comments for improving the text: Amir Ardestani, Polytechnic\\nUniversity of Teheran; Joe Blitzstein, Harvard University; Peter Nuesch, Univer-\\nsity of Lausaunne; Joseph Mitchell, SUNY, Stony Brook; Alan Chambless, actuary;Robert Kriner; Israel David, Ben-Gurion University; T.

If it turns\\nout that exactly mof the nantennas are defective, what is the probability that the\\nresulting system will be functional? For instance, in the special case where n=4 and\\nm=2, there are 6 possible system conﬁgurations, namely,\\n01100101\\n1010\\n00111001\\n1100\\nwhere 1 means that the antenna is working and 0 that it is defective. Because the\\nresulting system will be functional in the ﬁrst 3 arrangements and not functional in\\nthe remaining 3, it seems reasonable to take\\n3\\n6=1\\n2as the desired probability. In\\nthe case of general nandm, we could compute the probability that the system is\\nfunctional in a similar fashion. That is, we could count the number of conﬁgurations\\nthat result in the system’s being functional and then divide by the total number of allpossible conﬁgurations.\\nFrom the preceding discussion, we see that it would be useful to have an effec-\\ntive method for counting the number of ways that things can occur. In fact, manyproblems in probability theory can be solved simply by counting the number of dif-\\nferent ways that a certain event can occur. The mathematical theory of counting is\\nformally known as combinatorial analysis.\\n13', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content='14Chapter 1 Combinatorial Analysis\\n1.2 The Basic Principle of Counting\\nThe basic principle of counting will be fundamental to all our work. Loosely put, it\\nstates that if one experiment can result in any of mpossible outcomes and if another\\nexperiment can result in any of npossible outcomes, then there are mnpossible\\noutcomes of the two experiments.\\nThe basic principle of counting\\nSuppose that two experiments are to be performed. Then if experiment 1 can\\nresult in any one of mpossible outcomes and if, for each outcome of experiment\\n1, there are npossible outcomes of experiment 2, then together there are mn\\npossible outcomes of the two experiments.\\nProof of the Basic Principle: The basic principle may be proven by enumerating all\\nthe possible outcomes of the two experiments; that is,\\n(1, 1), (1, 2), ...,(1,n)\\n(2, 1), (2, 2), ...,(2,n)\\n#\\n##\\n(m,1 ),(m,2 ),...,(m,n)\\nwhere we say that the outcome is ( i,j) if experiment 1 results in its ith possible\\noutcome and experiment 2 then results in its jth possible outcome. Hence, the set of\\npossible outcomes consists of mrows, each containing nelements. This proves the\\nresult.\\nExample\\n2aA small community consists of 10 women, each of whom has 3 children. If one\\nwoman and one of her children are to be chosen as mother and child of the year,\\nhow many different choices are possible?\\nSolution By regarding the choice of the woman as the outcome of the ﬁrst experi-\\nment and the subsequent choice of one of her children as the outcome of the secondexperiment, we see from the basic principle that there are 10 *3=30 possible\\nchoices. .\\nWhen there are more than two experiments to be performed, the basic principle\\ncan be generalized.\\nThe generalized basic principle of counting\\nIfrexperiments that are to be performed are such that the ﬁrst one may result\\nin any of n1possible outcomes; and if, for each of these n1possible outcomes,\\nthere are n2possible outcomes of the second experiment; and if, for each of the\\npossible outcomes of the ﬁrst two experiments, there are n3possible outcomes\\nof the third experiment; and if ..., then there is a total of n1·n2···n rpossible\\noutcomes of the rexperiments.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 14}), Document(page_content='A First Course in Probability 15\\nExample\\n2bA college planning committee consists of 3 freshmen, 4 sophomores, 5 juniors, and 2\\nseniors. A subcommittee of 4, consisting of 1 person from each class, is to be chosen.How many different subcommittees are possible?\\nSolution We may regard the choice of a subcommittee as the combined outcome of\\nthe four separate experiments of choosing a single representative from each of the\\nclasses. It then follows from the generalized version of the basic principle that there\\nare 3 *4*5*2=120 possible subcommittees. .\\nExample\\n2cHow many different 7-place license plates are possible if the ﬁrst 3 places are to beoccupied by letters and the ﬁnal 4 by numbers?\\nSolution By the generalized version of the basic principle, the answer is 26 ·26·\\n26·10·10·10·10=175,760,000. .\\nExample\\n2dHow many functions deﬁned on npoints are possible if each functional value is\\neither 0 or 1?\\nSolution Let the points be 1, 2, ...,n. Since f(i)must be either 0 or 1 for each i=\\n1, 2, ...,n, it follows that there are 2npossible functions. .\\nExample\\n2eIn Example 2c, how many license plates would be possible if repetition among letters\\nor numbers were prohibited?\\nSolution In this case, there would be 26 ·25·24·10·9·8·7=78,624,000\\npossible license plates. .\\n1.3 Permutations\\nHow many different ordered arrangements of the letters a,b, and care possible?\\nBy direct enumeration we see that there are 6, namely, abc, acb, bac, bca, cab ,\\nandcba. Each arrangement is known as a permutation. Thus, there are 6 possible\\npermutations of a set of 3 objects. This result could also have been obtainedfrom the basic principle, since the ﬁrst object in the permutation can be any of\\nthe 3, the second object in the permutation can then be chosen from any of theremaining 2, and the third object in the permutation is then the remaining 1.\\nThus, there are 3 ·2·1=6 possible permutations.\\nSuppose now that we have nobjects. Reasoning similar to that we have just used\\nfor the 3 letters then shows that there are\\nn(n−1)(n−2)···3·2·1=n!\\ndifferent permutations of the nobjects.\\nWhereas n! (read as “n factorial”) is deﬁned to equal 1 ·2···nwhen nis a\\npositive integer, it is convenient to deﬁne 0! to equal 1.\\nExample\\n3aHow many different batting orders are possible for a baseball team consisting of 9players?\\nSolution There are 9! =362,880 possible batting orders. .', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 15}), Document(page_content='16Chapter 1 Combinatorial Analysis\\nExample\\n3bA class in probability theory consists of 6 men and 4 women.

Assume that notwo students obtain the same score.\\n(a)How many different rankings are possible?\\n(b)If the men are ranked just among themselves and the women just among them-selves, how many different rankings are possible?\\nSolution (a) Because each ranking corresponds to a particular ordered arrangement\\nof the 10 people, the answer to this part is 10! =3,628,800.\\n(b) Since there are 6! possible rankings of the men among themselves and 4!\\npossible rankings of the women among themselves, it follows from the basic principlethat there are (6!)(4! )=(720)(24) =17,280 possible rankings in this case. .\\nExample\\n3cMs. Jones has 10 books that she is going to put on her bookshelf. Of these, 4 are math-\\nematics books, 3 are chemistry books, 2 are history books, and 1 is a language book.\\nMs. Jones wants to arrange her books so that all the books dealing with the samesubject are together on the shelf. How many different arrangements are possible?\\nSolution There are 4! 3! 2! 1! arrangements such that the mathematics books are\\nﬁrst in line, then the chemistry books, then the history books, and then the languagebook. Similarly, for each possible ordering of the subjects, there are 4! 3! 2! 1! pos-sible arrangements. Hence, as there are 4! possible orderings of the subjects, the\\ndesired answer is 4! 4! 3! 2! 1! =6912. .\\nWe shall now determine the number of permutations of a set of nobjects when\\ncertain of the objects are indistinguishable from one another. To set this situation\\nstraight in our minds, consider the following example.\\nExample\\n3dHow many different letter arrangements can be formed from the letters PEPPER?\\nSolution We ﬁrst note that there are 6! permutations of the letters P1E1P2P3E2R\\nwhen the 3P ’s and the 2E ’s are distinguished from one another. However, consider\\nany one of these permutations—for instance, P1P2E1P3E2R. If we now permute the\\nP’s among themselves and the E’s among themselves, then the resultant arrangement\\nwould still be of the form PPEPER. That is, all 3! 2! permutations\\nP1P2E1P3E2RP 1P2E2P3E1R\\nP1P3E1P2E2RP 1P3E2P2E1R\\nP2P1E1P3E2RP 2P1E2P3E1R\\nP2P3E1P1E2RP 2P3E2P1E1R\\nP3P1E1P2E2RP 3P1E2P2E1R\\nP3P2E1P1E2RP 3P2E2P1E1R\\nare of the form PPEPER. Hence, there are 6! /(3! 2! )=60 possible letter arrange-\\nments of the letters PEPPER. .\\nIn general, the same reasoning as that used in Example 3d shows that there are\\nn!\\nn1!n2!···nr!\\ndifferent permutations of nobjects, of which n1are alike, n2are alike, ...,nrare\\nalike.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 16}), Document(page_content='A First Course in Probability 17\\nExample\\n3eA chess tournament has 10 competitors, of which 4 are Russian, 3 are from the\\nUnited States, 2 are from Great Britain, and 1 is from Brazil.

For instance, how many different\\ngroups of 3 could be selected from the 5 items A,B,C,D, and E? To answer this\\nquestion, reason as follows: Since there are 5 ways to select the initial item, 4 ways to\\nthen select the next item, and 3 ways to select the ﬁnal item, there are thus 5 ·4·3\\nways of selecting the group of 3 when the order in which the items are selected isrelevant. However, since every group of 3—say, the group consisting of items A,B,\\nandC—will be counted 6 times (that is, all of the permutations ABC, ACB, BAC,\\nBCA, CAB, and CBA will be counted when the order of selection is relevant), it\\nfollows that the total number of groups that can be formed is\\n5·4·3\\n3·2·1=10\\nIn general, as n(n−1)··· (n−r+1)represents the number of different ways that\\na group of ritems could be selected from nitems when the order of selection is\\nrelevant, and as each group of ritems will be counted r! times in this count, it follows\\nthat the number of different groups of ritems that could be formed from a set of n\\nitems is\\nn(n−1)··· (n−r+1)\\nr!=n!\\n(n−r)!r!\\nNotation and terminology\\nWe deﬁne(\\nn\\nr)\\n,f o rr…n,b y\\n(\\nnr)\\n=n!\\n(n−r)!r!', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 17}), Document(page_content='18Chapter 1 Combinatorial Analysis\\nand say that(\\nn\\nr)\\n(read as “n choose r”) represents the number of possible\\ncombinations of nobjects taken rat a time.\\nThus,(\\nn\\nr)\\nrepresents the number of different groups of size rthat could be\\nselected from a set of nobjects when the order of selection is not considered relevant.\\nEquivalently,(\\nn\\nr)\\nis the number of subsets of size rthat can be chosen from\\na set of size n. Using that 0! =1, note that(\\nn\\nn)\\n=(\\nn\\n0)\\n=n!\\n0!n!=1, which is\\nconsistent with the preceding interpretation because in a set of size nthere is exactly\\n1 subset of size n(namely, the entire set), and exactly one subset of size 0 (namely\\nthe empty set). A useful convention is to deﬁne(\\nn\\nr)\\nequal to 0 when either r>n\\norr<0.\\nExample\\n4aA committee of 3 is to be formed from a group of 20 people. How many different\\ncommittees are possible?\\nSolution There are(\\n20\\n3)\\n=20·19·18\\n3·2·1=1140 possible committees. .\\nExample\\n4bFrom a group of 5 women and 7 men, how many different committees consisting of\\n2 women and 3 men can be formed? What if 2 of the men are feuding and refuse to\\nserve on the committee together?\\nSolution As there are(\\n52)\\npossible groups of 2 women, and(\\n73)\\npossible groups\\nof 3 men, it follows from the basic principle that there are(\\n52)(\\n73)\\n=5·4\\n2·1.\\n7·6·5\\n3·2·1=350 possible committees consisting of 2 women and 3 men.\\nNow suppose that 2 of the men refuse to serve together. Because a total of(\\n22)(\\n51)\\n=5 out of the(\\n73)\\n=35 possible groups of 3 men contain both of\\nthe feuding men, it follows that there are 35 −5=30 groups that do not contain\\nboth of the feuding men. Because there are still(\\n5\\n2)\\n=10 ways to choose the 2\\nwomen, there are 30 ·10=300 possible committees in this case. .\\nExample\\n4cConsider a set of nantennas of which mare defective and n−mare functional\\nand assume that all of the defectives and all of the functionals are considered indis-tinguishable.

To answer this question, we note that\\nthere are(\\nn\\nn1)\\npossible choices for the ﬁrst group; for each choice of the ﬁrst group,\\nthere are(\\nn−n1\\nn2)\\npossible choices for the second group; for each choice of the\\nﬁrst two groups, there are(\\nn−n1−n2\\nn3)\\npossible choices for the third group; and\\nso on.

For instance, if n=8 and if n1=4,n2=3, and n3=1, then\\nthe permutation 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1 corresponds to assigning items 1, 2, 6, 8 to the ﬁrst\\ngroup, items 3, 5, 7 to the second group, and item 4 to the third group. Because every\\npermutation yields a division of the items and every possible division results fromsome permutation, it follows that the number of divisions of nitems into rdistinct\\ngroups of sizes n\\n1,n2,...,nris the same as the number of permutations of nitems\\nof which n1are alike, and n2are alike, ..., and nrare alike, which was shown in\\nSection 1.3 to equaln!\\nn1!n2!···nr!.\\nNotation\\nIfn1+n2+ ··· + nr=n, we deﬁne(\\nn\\nn1,n2,...,nr)\\nby\\n(\\nn\\nn1,n2,...,nr)\\n=n!\\nn1!n2!···nr!\\nThus,(\\nn\\nn1,n2,...,nr)\\nrepresents the number of possible divisions of ndistinct\\nobjects into rdistinct groups of respective sizes n1,n2,...,nr.\\nExample\\n5aA police department in a small city consists of 10 ofﬁcers.

(For instance,one outcome is that 1 beats 2, 3 beats 4, 5 beats 6, and 7 beats 8.)\\n(b)How many outcomes of the tournament are possible, where an outcome givescomplete information for all rounds?\\nSolution One way to determine the number of possible outcomes for the initial\\nround is to ﬁrst determine the number of possible pairings for that round. To do so,note that the number of ways to divide the 8 players into a ﬁrstpair, a second pair, a\\nthird pair, and a fourth pair is(8\\n2, 2, 2, 2)\\n=8!\\n24.Thus, the number of possible pair-\\nings when there is no ordering of the 4 pairs is8!\\n244!.For each such pairing, there are\\n2 possible choices from each pair as to the winner of that game, showing that there\\nare8!24\\n244!=8!\\n4!possible results of round 1. [Another way to see this is to note that\\nthere are(8\\n4)\\npossible choices of the 4 winners and, for each such choice, there are\\n4! ways to pair the 4 winners with the 4 losers, showing that there are 4!(84)\\n=8!\\n4!\\npossible results for the ﬁrst round.]\\nSimilarly, for each result of round 1, there are4!\\n2!possible outcomes of round 2,\\nand for each of the outcomes of the ﬁrst two rounds, there are2!\\n1!possible outcomes\\nof round 3.

Indeed, the same argument\\ncan be used to show that a knockout tournament of n=2mplayers has n! possible\\noutcomes.\\nKnowing the preceding result, it is not difﬁcult to come up with a more direct\\nargument by showing that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 23}), Document(page_content='24Chapter 1 Combinatorial Analysis\\npossible tournament results and the set of permutations of 1, ...,n. To obtain such\\na correspondence, rank the players as follows for any tournament result: Give the\\ntournament winner rank 1, and give the ﬁnal-round loser rank 2. For the two play-ers who lost in the next-to-last round, give rank 3 to the one who lost to the player\\nranked 1 and give rank 4 to the one who lost to the player ranked 2. For the four play-\\ners who lost in the second-to-last round, give rank 5 to the one who lost to playerranked 1, rank 6 to the one who lost to the player ranked 2, rank 7 to the one who\\nlost to the player ranked 3, and rank 8 to the one who lost to the player ranked 4.\\nContinuing on in this manner gives a rank to each player. (A more succinct descrip-\\ntion is to give the winner of the tournament rank 1 and let the rank of a player who\\nlost in a round having 2\\nkmatches be 2kplus the rank of the player who beat him, for\\nk=0,...,m−1.) In this manner, the result of the tournament can be represented\\nby a permutation i1,i2,...,in, where ijis the player who was given rank j. Because\\ndifferent tournament results give rise to different permutations, and because there isa tournament result for each permutation, it follows that there are the same number\\nof possible tournament results as there are permutations of 1, ...,n. .\\nExample\\n5e\\n(x1+x2+x3)2=(\\n2\\n2, 0, 0)\\nx2\\n1x0\\n2x03+(\\n2\\n0, 2, 0)\\nx0\\n1x2\\n2x0\\n3\\n+(\\n2\\n0, 0, 2)\\nx0\\n1x0\\n2x2\\n3+(\\n2\\n1, 1, 0)\\nx1\\n1x1\\n2x0\\n3\\n+(\\n2\\n1, 0, 1)\\nx1\\n1x0\\n2x1\\n3+(\\n2\\n0, 1, 1)\\nx0\\n1x1\\n2x13\\n=x2\\n1+x2\\n2+x23+2x1x2+2x1x3+2x2x3 .\\n*1.6 The Number of Integer Solutions of Equations\\nAn individual has gone ﬁshing at Lake Ticonderoga, which contains four types of\\nﬁsh: lake trout, catﬁsh, bass, and blueﬁsh.

If\\nnot all of the money needs to be invested, then if we let x5denote the amount kept in\\nreserve, a strategy is a nonnegative integer-valued vector (x1,x2,x3,x4,x5)satisfying\\nthe equation\\nx1+x2+x3+x4+x5=20\\nHence, by Proposition 6.2, there are now(\\n24\\n4)\\n=10,626 possible strategies. .\\nExample\\n6cHow many terms are there in the multinomial expansion of (x1+x2+ ··· + xr)n?\\nSolution\\n(x1+x2+ ··· + xr)n=∑(\\nn\\nn1,...,nr)\\nxn1\\n1···xnrr\\nwhere the sum is over all nonnegative integer-valued (n1,...,nr)such that n1+···+\\nnr=n. Hence, by Proposition 6.2, there are(\\nn+r−1\\nr−1)\\nsuch terms. .\\nExample\\n6dLet us consider again Example 4c, in which we have a set of nitems, of which mare\\n(indistinguishable and) defective and the remaining n−mare (also indistinguish-\\nable and) functional. Our objective is to determine the number of linear orderingsin which no two defectives are next to each other. To determine this number, let usimagine that the defective items are lined up among themselves and the functional\\nones are now to be put in position. Let us denote x\\n1as the number of functional\\nitems to the left of the ﬁrst defective, x2as the number of functional items between\\nthe ﬁrst two defectives, and so on. That is, schematically, we have\\nx10x20···xm0xm+1\\nNow, there will be at least one functional item between any pair of defectives as long\\nasxi>0,i=2,...,m. Hence, the number of outcomes satisfying the condition is\\nthe number of vectors x1,...,xm+1that satisfy the equation\\nx1+ ··· + xm+1=n−m, x1Ú0,xm+1 Ú0,xi>0,i=2,...,m', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 26}), Document(page_content='A First Course in Probability 27\\nBut, on letting y1=x1+1,yi=xi,i=2,...,m,ym+1=xm+1+1, we see that\\nthis number is equal to the number of positive vectors (y1,...,ym+1 )that satisfy the\\nequation\\ny1+y2+ ··· + ym+1=n−m+2\\nHence, by Proposition 6.1, there are(\\nn−m+1\\nm)\\nsuch outcomes, in agreement\\nwith the results of Example 4c.\\nSuppose now that we are interested in the number of outcomes in which each\\npair of defective items is separated by at least 2 functional items. By the same rea-\\nsoning as that applied previously, this would equal the number of vectors satisfying\\nthe equation\\nx1+ ··· + xm+1=n−m, x1Ú0,xm+1 Ú0,xiÚ2,i=2,...,m\\nUpon letting y1=x1+1,yi=xi−1,i=2,...,m,ym+1=xm+1+1, we see that\\nthis is the same as the number of positive solutions of the equation\\ny1+ ··· + ym+1=n−2m+3\\nHence, from Proposition 6.1, there are(\\nn−2m+2\\nm)\\nsuch outcomes. .\\nSummary\\nThe basic principle of counting states that if an experiment\\nconsisting of two phases is such that there are npossible\\noutcomes of phase 1 and, for each of these noutcomes,\\nthere are mpossible outcomes of phase 2, then there are\\nnmpossible outcomes of the experiment.\\nThere are n!=n(n−1)···3·2·1 possible linear\\norderings of nitems. The quantity 0! is deﬁned to equal 1.\\nLet\\n(\\nn\\ni)\\n=n!\\n(n−i)!i!\\nwhen 0 …i…n, and let it equal 0 otherwise. This quan-\\ntity represents the number of different subgroups of size i\\nthat can be chosen from a set of size n. It is often called abinomial coefﬁcient because of its prominence in the bino-\\nmial theorem, which states that\\n(x+y)n=n∑\\ni=0(\\nn\\ni)\\nxiyn−i\\nFor nonnegative integers n1,...,nrsumming to n,\\n(\\nn\\nn1,n2,...,nr)\\n=n!\\nn1!n2!···nr!\\nis the number of divisions of nitems into rdistinct\\nnonoverlapping subgroups of sizes n1,n2...,nr.These\\nquantities are called multinomial coefﬁcients.\\nProblems\\n1.(a)How many different 7-place license plates are possi-\\nble if the ﬁrst 2 places are for letters and the other 5 fornumbers?\\n(b)Repeat part (a) under the assumption that no letter or\\nnumber can be repeated in a single license plate.\\n2.How many outcome sequences are possible when a die\\nis rolled four times, where we say, for instance, that the\\noutcome is 3, 4, 3, 1 if the ﬁrst roll landed on 3, the second\\non 4, the third on 3, and the fourth on 1?3.Ten employees of a company are to be assigned to 10\\ndifferent managerial posts, one to each post.

If the experiment consists of measuring (in hours) the lifetime of a transistor,\\nthen the sample space consists of all nonnegative real numbers; that is,\\nS={x:0 …x<q}\\nAny subset Eof the sample space is known as an event. In other words, an event\\nis a set consisting of possible outcomes of the experiment. If the outcome of the\\nexperiment is contained in E, then we say that Ehas occurred.

To give such an event a name, we shall refer\\nto it as the null event and denote it by Ø. (That is, Ø refers to the event consisting of\\nno outcomes.) If EF=Ø, then EandFare said to be mutually exclusive .\\nWe deﬁne unions and intersections of more than two events in a similar manner.\\nIfE1,E2,...are events, then the union of these events, denoted byq⋃\\nn=1En, is deﬁned\\nto be that event that consists of all outcomes that are in Enfor at least one value\\nofn=1, 2,....

Such a deﬁnition usually goes as follows: We suppose that an experiment,\\nwhose sample space is S, is repeatedly performed under exactly the same conditions.\\nFor each event Eof the sample space S, we deﬁne n(E)to be the number of times', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 38}), Document(page_content='A First Course in Probability 39\\nin the ﬁrst nrepetitions of the experiment that the event Eoccurs. Then P(E),t h e\\nprobability of the event E, is deﬁned as\\nP(E)=limn→qn(E)\\nn\\nThat is, P(E)is deﬁned as the (limiting) proportion of time that Eoccurs. It is thus\\nthe limiting relative frequency of E.\\nAlthough the preceding deﬁnition is certainly intuitively pleasing and should\\nalways be kept in mind by the reader, it possesses a serious drawback: How do we\\nknow that n(E)/nwill converge to some constant limiting value that will be the same\\nfor each possible sequence of repetitions of the experiment? For example, suppose\\nthat the experiment to be repeatedly performed consists of ﬂipping a coin. How do\\nwe know that the proportion of heads obtained in the ﬁrst nﬂips will converge to\\nsome value as ngets large? Also, even if it does converge to some value, how do we\\nknow that, if the experiment is repeatedly performed a second time, we shall obtainthe same limiting proportion of heads?\\nProponents of the relative frequency deﬁnition of probability usually answer\\nthis objection by stating that the convergence of n(E)/nto a constant limiting value\\nis an assumption, or an axiom, of the system. However, to assume that n(E)/nwill\\nnecessarily converge to some constant value seems to be an extraordinarily compli-cated assumption. For, although we might indeed hope that such a constant limitingfrequency exists, it does not at all seem to be a priori evident that this need be the\\ncase. In fact, would it not be more reasonable to assume a set of simpler and more\\nself-evident axioms about probability and then attempt to prove that such a con-stant limiting frequency does in some sense exist? The latter approach is the modern\\naxiomatic approach to probability theory that we shall adopt in this text. In partic-\\nular, we shall assume that, for each event Ein the sample space S, there exists a\\nvalue P(E), referred to as the probability of E. We shall then assume that all these\\nprobabilities satisfy a certain set of axioms, which, we hope the reader will agree, isin accordance with our intuitive notion of probability.\\nConsider an experiment whose sample space is S. For each event Eof the sample\\nspace S, we assume that a number P(E)is deﬁned and satisﬁes the following three\\naxioms:\\nThe three axioms of probability\\nAxiom 1\\n0…P(E)…1\\nAxiom 2\\nP(S)=1\\nAxiom 3For any sequence of mutually exclusive events E\\n1,E2,...(that is, events for\\nwhich EiEj=Ø when iZj),\\nP⎛\\n⎝q⋃\\ni=1Ei⎞⎠=q∑\\ni=1P(Ei)\\nWe refer to P(E)as the probability of the event E.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 39}), Document(page_content='40Chapter 2 Axioms of Probability\\nThus, Axiom 1 states that the probability that the outcome of the experiment is\\nan outcome in Eis some number between 0 and 1. Axiom 2 states that, with proba-\\nbility 1, the outcome will be a point in the sample space S. Axiom 3 states that, for\\nany sequence of mutually exclusive events, the probability of at least one of these\\nevents occurring is just the sum of their respective probabilities.\\nIf we consider a sequence of events E1,E2,..., where E1=SandEi=Øf o r\\ni>1, then, because the events are mutually exclusive and because S=q⋃\\ni=1Ei,w e\\nhave, from Axiom 3,\\nP(S)=q∑\\ni=1P(Ei)=P(S)+q∑\\ni=2P(Ø)\\nimplying that\\nP(Ø)=0\\nThat is, the null event has probability 0 of occurring.\\nNote that it follows that, for any ﬁnite sequence of mutually exclusive events E1,\\nE2,...,En,\\nP⎛\\n⎝n⋃\\n1Ei⎞⎠=n∑\\ni=1P(Ei) (3.1)\\nThis equation follows from Axiom 3 by deﬁning Eias the null event for all values\\nofigreater than n. Axiom 3 is equivalent to Equation (3.1) when the sample space\\nis ﬁnite. (Why?) However, the added generality of Axiom 3 is necessary when the\\nsample space consists of an inﬁnite number of points.\\nExample\\n3aIf our experiment consists of tossing a coin and if we assume that a head is as likelyto appear as a tail, then we would have\\nP({H})=P({T})=1\\n2\\nOn the other hand, if the coin were biased and we believed that a head were twiceas likely to appear as a tail, then we would have\\nP({H})=2\\n3P({T})=1\\n3.\\nExample\\n3bIf a die is rolled and we suppose that all six sides are equally likely to appear, then\\nwe would have P({1})=P({2})=P({3})=P({4})=P({5})=P({6})=1\\n6.F r o m\\nAxiom 3, it would thus follow that the probability of rolling an even number would\\nequal\\nP({2, 4, 6}) =P({2})+P({4})+P({6})=1\\n2.\\nThe assumption of the existence of a set function P, deﬁned on the events of\\na sample space Sand satisfying Axioms 1, 2, and 3, constitutes the modern math-\\nematical approach to probability theory. It is hoped that the reader will agree that\\nthe axioms are natural and in accordance with our intuitive concept of probability as\\nrelated to chance and randomness.

We have supposed that P(E)is deﬁned for all the events E\\nof the sample space. Actually, when the sample space is an uncountably inﬁnite set,P(E)is deﬁned only for a class of events called measurable.

In the inclusion–exclusion identity, going out one term results in an upper\\nbound on the probability of the union, going out two terms results in a lower bound\\non the probability, going out three terms results in an upper bound on the proba-\\nbility, going out four terms results in a lower bound, and so on.

That is, consider an experiment whose sample space Sis\\na ﬁnite set, say, S={1, 2,...,N}. Then, it is often natural to assume that\\nP({1})=P({2})=···= P({N})', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 45}), Document(page_content='46Chapter 2 Axioms of Probability\\nwhich implies, from Axioms 2 and 3 (why?), that\\nP({i})=1\\nNi=1, 2,...,N\\nFrom this equation, it follows from Axiom 3 that, for any event E,\\nP(E)=number of outcomes in E\\nnumber of outcomes in S\\nIn words, if we assume that all outcomes of an experiment are equally likely to occur,\\nthen the probability of any event Eequals the proportion of outcomes in the sample\\nspace that are contained in E.\\nExample\\n5aIf two dice are rolled, what is the probability that the sum of the upturned faces willequal 7?\\nSolution We shall solve this problem under the assumption that all of the 36 possible\\noutcomes are equally likely. Since there are 6 possible outcomes—namely, (1, 6),(2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (6, 1)—that result in the sum of the dice being equal\\nto 7 , the desired probability is\\n6\\n36=1\\n6. .\\nExample\\n5bIf 3 balls are “randomly drawn” from a bowl containing 6 white and 5 black balls,\\nwhat is the probability that one of the balls is white and the other two black?\\nSolution If we regard the balls as being distinguishable and the order in which they\\nare selected as being relevant, then the sample space consists of 11 ·10·9=990\\noutcomes. Furthermore, there are 6 ·5·4=120 outcomes in which the ﬁrst ball\\nselected is white and the other two are black; 5 ·6·4=120 outcomes in which\\nthe ﬁrst is black, the second is white, and the third is black; and 5 ·4·6=120 in\\nwhich the ﬁrst two are black and the third is white. Hence, assuming that “randomly\\ndrawn” means that each outcome in the sample space is equally likely to occur, we\\nsee that the desired probability is\\n120+120+120\\n990=4\\n11\\nThis problem could also have been solved by regarding the outcome of the\\nexperiment as the unordered set of drawn balls. From this point of view, there are(\\n11\\n3)\\n=165 outcomes in the sample space. Now, each set of 3 balls corresponds\\nto 3! outcomes when the order of selection is noted. As a result, if all outcomes\\nare assumed equally likely when the order of selection is noted, then it follows that\\nthey remain equally likely when the outcome is taken to be the unordered set ofselected balls. Hence, using the latter representation of the experiment, we see that\\nthe desired probability is(\\n6\\n1)(\\n52)\\n(\\n11\\n3)=4\\n11\\nwhich, of course, agrees with the answer obtained previously. .', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 46}), Document(page_content='A First Course in Probability 47\\nWhen the experiment consists of a random selection of ki t e m sf r o mas e to f n\\nitems, we have the ﬂexibility of either letting the outcome of the experiment be the\\nordered selection of the kitems or letting it be the unordered set of items selected.\\nIn the former case, we would assume that each new selection is equally likely to be\\nany of the so far unselected items of the set, and in the latter case, we would assume\\nthat all(n\\nk)\\npossible subsets of kitems are equally likely to be the set selected. For\\ninstance, suppose 5 people are to be randomly selected from a group of 20 individu-\\nals consisting of 10 married couples, and we want to determine P(N), the probability\\nthat the 5 chosen are all unrelated. (That is, no two are married to each other.)\\nIf we regard the sample space as the set of 5 people chosen, then there are(20\\n5)\\nequally likely outcomes. An outcome that does not contain a married couple can\\nbe thought of as being the result of a six-stage experiment: In the ﬁrst stage, 5 of\\nthe 10 couples to have a member in the group are chosen; in the next 5 stages, 1\\nof the 2 members of each of these couples is selected.

Therefore,\\nP{special ball is selected }=(\\n1\\n1)(\\nn−1\\nk−1)\\n(\\nnk) =k\\nn\\nWe could also have obtained this result by letting Aidenote the event that the special\\nball is the ith ball to be chosen, i=1,...,k. Then, since each one of the nballs is\\nequally likely to be the ith ball chosen, it follows that P(Ai)=1/n. Hence, because\\nthese events are clearly mutually exclusive, we have\\nP{special ball is selected }=P⎛\\n⎝k⋃\\ni=1Ai⎞⎠=k∑\\ni=1P(Ai)=k\\nn\\nWe could also have argued that P(Ai)=1/n, by noting that there are n(n−1)···\\n(n−k+1)=n!/(n −k)! equally likely outcomes of the experiment, of which\\n(n−1)(n−2)···(n−i+1)(1)(n −i)···(n−k+1)=(n−1)!/(n −k)! result\\nin the special ball being the ith one chosen. From this reasoning, it follows that\\nP(Ai)=(n−1)!\\nn!=1\\nn.\\nExample\\n5eSuppose that n+mballs, of which nare red and mare blue, are arranged in a linear\\norder in such a way that all (n+m)! possible orderings are equally likely. If we\\nrecord the result of this experiment by listing only the colors of the successive balls,\\nshow that all the possible results remain equally likely.\\nSolution Consider any one of the (n+m)! possible orderings, and note that any per-\\nmutation of the red balls among themselves and of the blue balls among themselvesdoes not change the sequence of colors. As a result, every ordering of colorings cor-responds to n!m! different orderings of the n+mballs, so every ordering of the\\ncolors has probability\\nn!m!\\n(n+m)!of occurring.\\nFor example, suppose that there are 2 red balls, numbered r1,r2, and 2 blue balls,\\nnumbered b1,b2. Then, of the 4! possible orderings, there will be 2! 2! orderings that\\nresult in any speciﬁed color combination. For instance, the following orderings result\\nin the successive balls alternating in color, with a red ball ﬁrst:\\nr1,b1,r2,b2r1,b2,r2,b1r2,b1,r1,b2r2,b2,r1,b1\\nTherefore, each of the possible orderings of the colors has probability4\\n24=1\\n6of\\noccurring. .\\nExample\\n5fA poker hand consists of 5 cards. If the cards have distinct consecutive values andare not all of the same suit, we say that the hand is a straight. For instance, a hand\\nconsisting of the ﬁve of spades, six of spades, seven of spades, eight of spades, andnine of hearts is a straight. What is the probability that one is dealt a straight?', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 48}), Document(page_content='A First Course in Probability 49\\nSolution We start by assuming that all(\\n52\\n5)\\npossible poker hands are equally\\nlikely. To determine the number of outcomes that are straights, let us ﬁrst deter-\\nmine the number of possible outcomes for which the poker hand consists of an ace,two, three, four, and ﬁve (the suits being irrelevant). Since the ace can be any 1 of the\\n4 possible aces, and similarly for the two, three, four, and ﬁve, it follows that there\\nare 4\\n5outcomes leading to exactly one ace, two, three, four, and ﬁve. Hence, since\\nin 4 of these outcomes all the cards will be of the same suit (such a hand is called a\\nstraight ﬂush), it follows that there are 45−4 hands that make up a straight of the\\nform ace, two, three, four, and ﬁve. Similarly, there are 45−4 hands that make up a\\nstraight of the form ten, jack, queen, king, and ace. Thus, there are 10 (45−4)hands\\nthat are straights, and it follows that the desired probability is\\n10(45−4)(\\n52\\n5) L.0039 .\\nExample\\n5gA 5-card poker hand is said to be a full house if it consists of 3 cards of the same\\ndenomination and 2 other cards of the same denomination (of course, different fromthe ﬁrst denomination). Thus, a full house is three of a kind plus a pair. What is the\\nprobability that one is dealt a full house?\\nSolution Again, we assume that all(\\n52\\n5)\\npossible hands are equally likely. To\\ndetermine the number of possible full houses, we ﬁrst note that there are(\\n4\\n2)(\\n43)\\ndifferent combinations of, say, 2 tens and 3 jacks. Because there are 13 different\\nchoices for the kind of pair and, after a pair has been chosen, there are 12 other\\nchoices for the denomination of the remaining 3 cards, it follows that the probabilityof a full house is\\n13·12·(\\n42)(\\n43)\\n(\\n52\\n5) L.0014 .\\nExample\\n5hIn the game of bridge, the entire deck of 52 cards is dealt out to 4 players. What isthe probability that\\n(a)one of the players receives all 13 spades;\\n(b)each player receives 1 ace?\\nSolution (a) Letting Eibe the event that hand ihas all 13 spades, then\\nP(Ei)=1\\n(52\\n13),i=1, 2, 3, 4', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 49}), Document(page_content='50Chapter 2 Axioms of Probability\\nBecause the events Ei,i=1, 2, 3, 4, are mutually exclusive, the probability that one\\nof the hands is dealt all 13 spades is\\nP(∪4\\ni=1Ei)=4∑\\ni=1P(Ei)=4/(52\\n13)\\nL6.3*10−12\\n(b) Let the outcome of the experiment be the sets of 13 cards of each of the\\nplayers 1, 2, 3, 4. To determine the number of outcomes in which each of the dis-\\ntinct players receives exactly 1 ace, put aside the aces and note that there are(\\n48\\n12, 12, 12, 12)\\npossible divisions of the other 48 cards when each player is to\\nreceive 12. Because there are 4! ways of dividing the 4 aces so that each player\\nreceives 1, we see that the number of possible outcomes in which each player receives\\nexactly 1 ace is 4!(\\n48\\n12, 12, 12, 12)\\n.\\nAs there are(52\\n13,13,13,13)\\npossible hands, the desired probability is thus\\n4!(48\\n12,12,12,12)\\n(52\\n13,13,13,13)L.1055 .\\nSome results in probability are quite surprising when initially encountered. Our\\nnext two examples illustrate this phenomenon.\\nExample\\n5iIfnpeople are present in a room, what is the probability that no two of them cele-\\nbrate their birthday on the same day of the year? How large need nbe so that this\\nprobability is less than1\\n2?\\nSolution As each person can celebrate his or her birthday on any one of 365 days,\\nthere are a total of (365)npossible outcomes. (We are ignoring the possibility of\\nsomeone having been born on February 29.) Assuming that each outcome is equally\\nlikely, we see that the desired probability is (365)(364)(363)...( 365−n+1)/(365)n.\\nIt is a rather surprising fact that when nÚ23, this probability is less than1\\n2.T h a ti s ,i f\\nthere are 23 or more people in a room, then the probability that at least two of them\\nhave the same birthday exceeds1\\n2. Many people are initially surprised by this result,\\nsince 23 seems so small in relation to 365, the number of days of the year. However,\\nevery pair of individuals has probability365\\n(365)2=1\\n365of having the same birthday,\\nand in a group of 23 people, there are(\\n23\\n2)\\n=253 different pairs of individuals.\\nLooked at this way, the result no longer seems so surprising.\\nWhen there are 50 people in the room, the probability that at least two share the\\nsame birthday is approximately .970, and with 100 persons in the room, the odds are\\nbetter than 3,000,000:1. (That is, the probability is greater than3*106\\n3*106+1that at\\nleast two people have the same birthday.) .\\nExample\\n5jA deck of 52 playing cards is shufﬂed, and the cards are turned up one at a time until\\nthe ﬁrst ace appears. Is the next card—that is, the card following the ﬁrst ace—morelikely to be the ace of spades or the two of clubs?', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 50}), Document(page_content='A First Course in Probability 51\\nSolution To determine the probability that the card following the ﬁrst ace is the\\nace of spades, we need to calculate how many of the (52)! possible orderings of the\\ncards have the ace of spades immediately following the ﬁrst ace. To begin, note thateach ordering of the 52 cards can be obtained by ﬁrst ordering the 51 cards different\\nfrom the ace of spades and then inserting the ace of spades into that ordering. Fur-\\nthermore, for each of the (51)! orderings of the other cards, there is only one placewhere the ace of spades can be placed so that it follows the ﬁrst ace. For instance, if\\nthe ordering of the other 51 cards is\\n4c,6h,Jd,5s,Ac,7d,...,Kh\\nthen the only insertion of the ace of spades into this ordering that results in its fol-lowing the ﬁrst ace is\\n4c,6h,Jd,5s,Ac,As,7d,...,Kh\\nTherefore, there are (51)! orderings that result in the ace of spades following the ﬁrst\\nace, so\\nP{the ace of spades follows the ﬁrst ace }=(51)!\\n(52)!=1\\n52\\nIn fact, by exactly the same argument, it follows that the probability that the two\\nof clubs (or any other speciﬁed card) follows the ﬁrst ace is also1\\n52. In other words,\\neach of the 52 cards of the deck is equally likely to be the one that follows the ﬁrst\\nace!\\nMany people ﬁnd this result rather surprising. Indeed, a common reaction is to\\nsuppose initially that it is more likely that the two of clubs (rather than the ace of\\nspades) follows the ﬁrst ace, since that ﬁrst ace might itself be the ace of spades. This\\nreaction is often followed by the realization that the two of clubs might itself appearbefore the ﬁrst ace, thus negating its chance of immediately following the ﬁrst ace.\\nHowever, as there is one chance in four that the ace of spades will be the ﬁrst ace\\n(because all 4 aces are equally likely to be ﬁrst) and only one chance in ﬁve thatthe two of clubs will appear before the ﬁrst ace (because each of the set of 5 cards\\nconsisting of the two of clubs and the 4 aces is equally likely to be the ﬁrst of this set\\nto appear), it again appears that the two of clubs is more likely. However, this is notthe case, and our more complete analysis shows that they are equally likely. .\\nExample\\n5kA football team consists of 20 offensive and 20 defensive players. The players are to\\nbe paired in groups of 2 for the purpose of determining roommates. If the pairing is\\ndone at random, what is the probability that there are no offensive–defensive room-mate pairs? What is the probability that there are 2i offensive–defensive roommate\\npairs, i=1, 2,..., 10?\\nSolution There are (\\n40\\n2, 2,...,2)\\n=(40)!\\n(2!)20\\nways of dividing the 40 players into 20 ordered pairs of two each. (That is, there\\nare(40)!/220ways of dividing the players into a ﬁrstpair, a second pair, and so on.)\\nHence, there are (40)!/220(20)! ways of dividing the players into (unordered) pairs of\\n2 each. Furthermore, since a division will result in no offensive–defensive pairs if theoffensive (and defensive) players are paired among themselves, it follows that there', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 51}), Document(page_content='52Chapter 2 Axioms of Probability\\nare [(20)!/210(10)!]2such divisions. Hence, the probability of no offensive–defensive\\nroommate pairs, call it P0, is given by\\nP0=((20)!\\n210(10)!)2\\n(40)!\\n220(20)!=[(20)!]3\\n[(10)!]2(40)!\\nTo determine P2i, the probability that there are 2i offensive–defensive pairs, we ﬁrst\\nnote that there are(\\n20\\n2i)2\\nways of selecting the 2i offensive players and the 2 idefen-\\nsive players who are to be in the offensive–defensive pairs. These 4 iplayers can then\\nbe paired up into (2i)! possible offensive–defensive pairs. (This is so because the\\nﬁrst offensive player can be paired with any of the 2 idefensive players, the second\\noffensive player with any of the remaining 2 i−1 defensive players, and so on.)\\nAs the remaining 20 −2ioffensive (and defensive) players must be paired among\\nthemselves, it follows that there are\\n(\\n20\\n2i)2\\n(2i)![(20−2i)!\\n210−i(10−i)!]2\\ndivisions that lead to 2i offensive–defensive pairs. Hence,\\nP2i=(\\n20\\n2i)2\\n(2i)![(20−2i)!\\n210−i(10−i)!]2\\n(40)!\\n220(20)!i=0, 1,...,1 0\\nTheP2i,i=0, 1,..., 10, can now be computed, or they can be approximated by\\nmaking use of a result of Stirling, which shows that n! can be approximated by\\nnn+1/ 2e−n√\\n2π. For instance, we obtain\\nP0L1.3403 *10−6\\nP10L.345861\\nP20L7.6068 *10−6.\\nOur next three examples illustrate the usefulness of the inclusion–exclusion iden-\\ntity (Proposition 4.4). In Example 5l, the introduction of probability enables us to\\nobtain a quick solution to a counting problem.\\nExample\\n5lA total of 36 members of a club play tennis, 28 play squash, and 18 play badminton.Furthermore, 22 of the members play both tennis and squash, 12 play both tennisand badminton, 9 play both squash and badminton, and 4 play all three sports.
